/**
 * Last-read snapshot storage for 3-way merge fallback.
 *
 * A single snapshot is kept in memory (the most recent non-raw `read`).
 * It is consulted when an `edit` finds stale anchors against the current
 * file. If the anchors match the snapshot, the edits are replayed on the
 * snapshot and the resulting patch is merged onto the live file.
 *
 * Snapshots do NOT survive session switches, reloads, or restarts.
